# *Unofficial* Google ARCore Swift Package for iOS

Google don't have a swift package for their ARCore SDK, so I'm attempting at making them for us iOS developers who don't want to CocoaPods anymore.

Not currently working, need more dependencies to be moved to swiftpm too.

See more about Google's ARCore SDK here:
